What does the project do?
    the specific subreddit 'ProgrammingBuddies' is about finding partners to do programming activies with.
    my goal for this project is to post a comment of similar posts to a post(if there are any) on the post, for each new post.
    this could  clean up the subreddit from redundant posts, and connect users together.


Program Flow:
    Fetch-Data --> post-analysis --> post-comments





TODO 

step<1> POSTS ANALYSIS:
    - run the analysis in ipynb
    - move the code to the project
    - test the code
    * beautify this README
    * ship feature

step<2> comment top result (if bigger than some threshhold) on a post if :
    * comment on the most relevent post with a link to the post and a paragraph

IDEAS: 
* check if reddit has an rss channel to check for updates - instead it running as a cronjob, run it dynamically when the subreddit posts change
